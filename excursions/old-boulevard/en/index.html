                            That day, when Aunt Apollinaria left them, the first snow fell. Myroslava was coming back
                            from school, as usual, through the boulevard and the park. Snowflakes began flying as she
                            turned onto the <strong>first boulevard</strong>; it seemed to her that the trees above her
                            head rustled,
                            sighed, or lightly groaned. She looked up at the sky – it was lying on top of the trees,
                            dirty blue, viscous, as if the twigs were cutting into Its swollen flesh.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The wind died down when she stepped onto the <strong>second boulevard</strong>, and it
                            became eerily quiet.
                            There was not a single soul on the boulevard, only herself, and frightened by that strange
                            silence, the girl suddenly stopped. Then the sky above her head shuddered, and the snow fell
                            raggedly, slowly; the surrounding air turned white, and snowflakes gently descended onto the
                            yellow alley with the remains of fallen leaves, − on those leaves, on the benches, on her
                            hand holding the backpack, on the white woollen headscarf, melting on her cheeks and
                            forehead. She held out her palm in front of her, and snowflakes began to settle on it. Pale
                            figures, they glowed just for a moment and disappeared, their life was like a breath.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She walked slowly, twisting a leaf, and the trees swayed like decorations shaken by a draft;
                            the world seemed to expand in front of her – a sea of white dancing specks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And she floated on it, or rather, walked on the bottom of the sea – <strong>a small, wispy
                                person of
                                this world</strong>, like one of these trees, which suddenly pulled out its roots from
                            the ground and
                            walked. And it seemed to her that time does not exist, that <strong>neither yesterday nor
                                tomorrow
                                exists, but there is only</strong> this white snowfall – <strong>the time of some great,
                                secret revelation</strong>.
                            It seemed to her that from the moment she set foot on this yellow earthy boulevard, between
                            these black trunks, under these branches melted into the sky slush, she began to experience
                            something special, unprecedented – <strong>she was leaving behind</strong> not a string of
                            invisible traces,
                            but <strong>herself as a child</strong>, who, walking along on this yellow road,
                            <strong>enters</strong> not just into space,
                            but <strong>the unexplored version of herself, into almost grown herself, the wise
                                herself</strong>. That's
                            why she walked so carefully, that's why she felt such quiet joy – only special moments bring
                            such experiences.

                            The Old Boulevard received its current name in 1991, evolving from names like Third
                            International Street, Stalin Prospect, and October Boulevard. It was established in the
                            1870s on land previously owned by the Catholic Convent of the Sisters of Mercy. In the
                            1960s, colonnades, descents to the Teteriv River, and residential buildings were added. By
                            1980, renovations for the Olympics gave the park its modern appearance. The Boulevard is
                            divided into four parts, each with its own unique story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The First Boulevard features remnants of a monument removed in 2022, symbolizing Ukraine’s
                            break with its imperial Russian past. The Second Boulevard had a similar fate, with a
                            memorial to Shchors destroyed during World War II. The Third Boulevard houses the Polissya
                            Stadium, originally built as Dynamo but rebuilt after wartime destruction. The Fourth
                            Boulevard honors Baron Ivan de Chaudoir, an artist, collector, and philanthropist who
                            contributed to the area’s development. In 2024, a memorial plaque was dedicated to him, and
                            the park was renamed in his honor.

                            psychological and Gothic prose. A member of the National Writers’ Union of Ukraine, he

                            Born in a shoemaker’s family in 1939, Shevchuk grew up immersed in Ukrainian classics,
                            sparking his lifelong passion for literature. His literary journey began with poetry, but
                            soon shifted to prose. In 1961, he published his debut short story, <em>“Nastunka”</em>,
                            dedicated to
                            Taras Shevchenko. After studying at the Faculty of History and Philosophy in Kyiv, he joined
                            literary studios and established himself as a prominent writer by the 1960s.

                            during the 1950s and 60s. Shevchuk masterfully examines the psychological struggles of his
                            characters—intellectuals, workers, and officials—each searching for purpose and harmony in a
                            world of loneliness and spiritual emptiness.
