                            The main administrative centres of the city and the region are located here. In the

                            early 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, a small nameless river flowed through this place, so the
                            surrounding
                            area was swampy. In the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, this spot was the city’s borderline.

                            there was a large garden belonging to the Monastery of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy. In
                            the 1950s, the regional council building and a small square were constructed, forming what
                            was then known as the Maidan of the City Council. In 1971, a monument to Academician Serhiy
                            Koroliov was unveiled, and for the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his birth, the square was
                            renamed
                            “Maidan Koroliova”.

                            acquired by the Mariinsky Women's Gymnasium. By the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, it was the

                            secondary school for women in the Volyn Governorate. Among its notable students were Zoia
                            Gaidai, Nina and Olga Kosach, Veronika Morozivna, and the mother of Sviatoslav Richter.
                            After the gymnasium was closed in 1919, the building was repurposed as a first aid station,
                            a school, and the Korolov District Executive Committee, and, since 1983, it has housed the
                            Zhytomyr Center for Children's and Youth Arts and Creativity.

                            compound also housed the editorial office of <em>Volyn</em> newspaper, where Mykhailo

                            Born in 1935 in Mlynyshche, Yevhen Kontsevych was a writer who turned hardship into
                            creativity. At 17, a failed dive left him bedridden, but he found solace in literature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His writing debut came in 1956, and in 1962, literary critic Leonid Novychenko praised his
                            deep humanism. Kontsevych’s works, marked by integrity, rejected hypocrisy and injustice.
                        <p>
                            In 1972, his support for the dissident movement led to a KGB search and a publishing ban.
                            Only in 1985 was his second book, <em>Leaving the Cheekbone</em>. His novel <em>Live, Live,
                                Live!</em> embodied his life philosophy: “I can fight.I will strain my will—only to
                            live.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite challenges, Kontsevych kept his humour, jokingly calling himself an “honorary
                            citizen of Zhytomyr” with free tram rides—even abroad. A fighter to the end, he inspired
                            perseverance against all odds.

                            One of the unique symbols of his life is a seven-meter-long homespun towel on which famous

                            and others, left their signatures for 50 years. Kontsevych embroidered the autographs, and
                            his wife was involved in the process. After the writer's death in July 2010, the
                            towel was transferred to the Zhytomyr Literary Museum. In 2023, the towel was shown to
                            visitors for the first time during the literary art zone “Mosaic of the Ukrainian Soul” in
                            the Zhytomyr Regional Library for Children and Youth.

                        <p>
                            “Spoons” is an underrated novella by Yevhen Kontsevych, offering deep insight into his inner
                            world. Through the protagonist, Andriy, the story reflects the author’s struggles, emotions,
                            and search for meaning. Interestingly, Kontsevych also carved spoons in real life to earn a
                            living.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At first glance, the novella seems simple, yet it brims with intense emotions—loss of hope,
                            frustration, and despair. Andriy’s pain mirrors Kontsevych’s own: “He asked her for such a
                            pittance… his throat was peppered with an acrid aftertaste he could neither swallow nor
                            exhale.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The story explores resilience and faith, emphasizing that hardships are trials
                            meant to strengthen the soul. The ending reveals life’s true meaning—cherishing what we have
                            before it’s lost.
